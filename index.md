Hi! I'm Gabriel, a 20 year old Computer Science student from Greece, willing to extend my programming skills throughout this course (and apparently my whole life).

Most of my projects/repositories are private, however I have two public Python-oriented repos you might be interested in checking out. One is [PythonCMD](https://github.com/GabrielRogd/PythonCMD). Initially a high school project from back in 2022, it utilizes a "shell" where you can run a list of customized functions, including a Windows command emulation concept.

This page is still under progression. [Original template](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)
